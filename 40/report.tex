\section{Testing}
The receiver was run on a computer in the DCF and sender on my laptop.

Run 1:
50 packets were sent for each test case.


For Packet generation rate 10:

\begin{tabular} {l l l l }
Packet Length & Error Probablity & Throughput (Kbps) & Transmission Efficiency Ratio\\ \hline
128 & 0.01 & 11.01 & 1.02\\
1024 & 0.01 & 84.64 & 1.00\\
128 & 0.00001 & 10.48 & 1.48\\
1024 & 0.00001 & 83.21 & 1.00\\
\end{tabular}


For Packet generation rate 200:

\begin{tabular} {l l l l }
Packet Length & Error Probablity & Throughput (Kbps) & Transmission Efficiency Ratio\\ \hline
128 & 0.01 & 198.17 & 1.00\\
1024 & 0.01 & 1620.33 & 1.00\\
128 & 0.00001 & 31.41 & 1.3\\
1024 & 0.00001 & 1589.49 & 1.0\\
\end{tabular}


Run 2:
500 packets were sent for each test case.

For Packet generation rate 10:

\begin{tabular} {l l l l }
Packet Length & Error Probablity & Throughput (Kbps) & Transmission Efficiency Ratio\\ \hline
128 & 0.01 &     10.03 & 1.02\\
1024 & 0.01 &    87.09 & 1.01\\
128 & 0.00001 &  9.94 & 1.00\\
1024 & 0.00001 & 85.31 & 1.08\\
\end{tabular}


For Packet generation rate 200:

\begin{tabular} {l l l l }
Packet Length & Error Probablity & Throughput (Kbps) & Transmission Efficiency Ratio\\ \hline
128 & 0.01 & 192.75 & 1.002\\
1024 & 0.01 & 1602.31 & 1.014\\
128 & 0.00001 & 201.33 & 1.00\\
1024 & 0.00001 & 1604.89 & 1.00\\
\end{tabular}


\section{Observation}
Sometimes, the first packet was sent multiple times (around 10)
even though it had been acknowledged the first time. The timeout was occuring
before the acknowledgement was received. Most of the packets that were resent were
due to this, and not due to being considered as corrupted by the sender, as the error 
rates were pretty low.

Throughput increased as packet lenghts increased. Probability of error was not 
dependant on length of packet, so longer packets were not more likely to get corrupted.
