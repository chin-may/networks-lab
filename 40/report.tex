\section{Testing}
The receiver was run on a computer in the DCF and sender on my laptop.

For Packet generation rate 10:

\begin{tabular} {l l l l }
Packet Length & Error Probablity & Throughput (Mbps) & Transmission Efficiency Ratio\\ \hline
128 & 0.01 & 5.12 & 3.7\\
128 & 0.00001 & 10.24 & 1\\
1024 & 0.01 & 81.92 & 1\\
1024 & 0.00001 & inf & 1\\
\end{tabular}


For Packet generation rate 200:

\begin{tabular} {l l l l }
Packet Length & Error Probablity & Throughput (Mbps) & Transmission Efficiency Ratio\\ \hline
128 & 0.01 & 10.24 & 2.1\\
128 & 0.00001 & inf & 1.1\\
1024 & 0.01 & inf & 1\\
1024 & 0.00001 & inf & 1\\
\end{tabular}

\section{Observation}
Sometimes, the first packet was sent multiple times (around 10)
even though it had been acknowledged the first time. The timeout was occuring
before the acknowledgement was received.
